# Horizon Occlusion for Normal Mapped Reflections

When rendering reflective surfaces with normal maps, something often goes wrong:

With just about any normal map this happens quite a bit - the reflection vector ends up pointing *behind* the surface being rendered. If this vector is then used for shading, a surface can end up receiving light that should never have reached it. This is mitigated sometimes by shadow mapping or other occlusion terms, but in the case of image-based lighting it can be especially tricky to avoid this kind of “light leaking”. Here is a sphere lit with a single environment map that illustrates the problem well:

Toolbag’s renderer uses a simple technique to help correct this. As far as I know it’s my invention, but it’s easy enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to learn it has been done elsewhere.

The gist is that we need to start occluding light coming in along these “underground” reflection vectors. We have enough knowledge of the local surface that we can fairly easily detect this case with a single dot product between the per-pixel reflection vector and the interpolated vertex normal. When this dot product becomes negative, we know we have a reflection vector pointing beneath the surface horizon, and we can then occlude the light.

In practice it looks a bit better to make this a gradual falloff rather than a hard terminator. The formulation in Toolbag looks like this:

A quick before-and-after comparison, on our normal-mapped sphere from above:

As you can see it helps greatly with the apparent intensity of “leaked” reflections. It doesn’t completely fix the problem, and if the fade constant is too high it can over-darken things, but when well balanced it’s a clear improvement. The fade parameter is best left as a per-material setting so that artists can adjust it to suit their work.

There are several ways this might be further improved. The formulation could take surface roughness/gloss into account, or do something other than darken the reflection in response. But even this simple addition as written above has provided a nice quality bump to Toolbag’s renderer.
